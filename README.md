Applied Statistics Course Notes in R/R-Markdown


These are course notes for Applied Statistics with R and R-markdown. 
They are designed for a 15 week course for students with Calculus I, II, and III.

Each file is designed to take approximately 3 hours of class time. There are also homework problems and solutions that I have not made available.
